# Hangman

Some rules of the game:
A user is allowed 8 guesses. Make sure to remind the user of how many guesses s/he has left after each round. Players can only ever submit one character at a time (A-Z).

A user loses a guess only when s/he guesses incorrectly.

The game will end when the user constructs the full word or runs out of guesses. If the player runs out of guesses (s/he "loses"), reveals the word to the user when the game ends.
